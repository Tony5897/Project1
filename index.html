  </p>
    My name is Tony Martinez, I am 30 years old and 
    a new student here at Epicodus. <p>
    </p>I was born right here in Portland, OR but 
    was raised in a small town 
    called Hubbard.<p>
    Previously, I was a truck driver
    who got see a lot of Oregon in his time on the road<p>

    </p>
    and is now getting the opportunity explore an entire 
    new territory in the <em> world of technology</em>.<p>
    </p>
    I attended community college at Portland Community College couple years ago and while there I
    took a computer<p>
    science and HTML class, which was what
    sparked my interest in technology and here I<p>
    am now. I am very excited to see where my new coding skills 
    will take in the not too distant future.
